eibon
==========

This repo contains all the dotfiles from my desktop pc (eibon).

File and directory structure
----------------------------

I keep all my precious dotfiles in the ~/.eibon folder and symlink
them to my home folder and other places, where the apps are looking for
them. This way I can store them in a dedicated place and don't need to
search for them, when I'd like to change something. Also this way I can keep
them without using the . in their name (so they aren't hidden, I use the
. in the link).

Guarantee
---------

No guarantee. If you use them, have enough common sense to read the files
through before you mess up your system.
